# Base16 Textual Style Builder

## About

This is a script which generates styles for the [Textual IRC client](http://www.codeux.com/textual/) based on the colour schemes of [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) by [chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson) and the default *Simplified* style bundled with Textual.

This repository is for someone who wants to customize the styles. If you just want to use the styles in their default configuration, you can use the ready-to-use styles at [base16-textual](https://github.com/FroZnShiva/base16-textual).
You can also see previews of the styles there.

## Usage

Clone the repository and switch into it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/FroZnShiva/base16-builder-textual
cd base16-builder-textual
```

Generate the styles by running:
```sh
./base16-textual
```
The styles are stored in the `output` directory by default.
